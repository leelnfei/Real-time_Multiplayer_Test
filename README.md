# Real-time Multiplayer Test
This project is a sample project utilizing Unity game engine's new [Real-time Multiplayer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer) solution. 

## Transport Layer Test
The *TransportLayerTest* scene found in *Assets/Scenes* uses Unity's new [transport layer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer/tree/master/com.unity.transport).

The scripts found in *Assets/Scripts/TransportLayer* are updated versions of scripts found in the [transport layer documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer/tree/master/com.unity.transport/Documentation/samples). The documentation is out of date so the scripts needed to be updated to work with the current APIs. A description of what is going on can be found in the transport layer documentation under the [Workflow: Creating a minimal client and server](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer/blob/master/com.unity.transport/Documentation/workflow-client-server.md) section.
